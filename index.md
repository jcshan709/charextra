# Charextra
Extra chars for Node.js and Typescript.  
# How to use?
Install:
```
npm i charextra
```
Pattern:
```javascript
charextra.<symbol name>
```
For example:
```javascript
const charextra = require('charextra')
const log = console.log
log(charextra.check)
```
Run it and you'll see a green tick (In fact, it's a green square root symbol)  
# Support charactors
This package only supports few charactors, but I'll add more in the future.  
|symbol name|charactor|
|-|-|
|sqrt|A square root symbol|
|check|A green tick(green square root symbol)|
|X|A red 'X'|
|failed|The same as above|
|invaild|The same as above|
|happy|:-)|
|sad|:-(|
|laugh|:-D|
|fatal|A bold red string "FATAL"|
|error|A red string "ERROR"|
|warn|A yellow string "WARN"|
|info|A green string "INFO"|
